Fell into a Google Hangout today from a Twitter link posted by Ward Cunningham. Very pleased with the warm welcome and encouaged to figure out more. I knew a couple of the people from the web, Frances Bell and Jenny Makness from various MOOCs and other projects related to tech supported ed. 

I hope to do more with this and figure out exactly what is going on and what the possibilies are. 

So pleased to connect the Ward especially, I've been a fan since I first started hearing about wikis in the late 90s/
